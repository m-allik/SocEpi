Description: Tools for calculating deprivation measures and analysing health outcomes and mortality by deprivation.
    Included are the functions: `zscore` and `w_pcntile` for developing deprivation measures and the functions `smr`,
    `st_rate` and `rii` for calculating standardized mortality ratios, direct standardized rates and Slope and Relative
    indecis of Inequallity (SII and RII). Test data is included (*dep_data* and *health_data*).
    The RII/SII are calculated following Pamuk ER (1985) <doi://doi.org/10.1080/0032472031000141256>.
    The confidence intervals for SII/RII are calculated using a multinomial distribution as described in Lumme et al (2015)
